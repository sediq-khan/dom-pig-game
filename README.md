The Udemy Javascript class assignment. The UI (HTML, CSS) was given by the course, but I have just added the Javascript part. This is a different solution from what the instructor has offered.

I have just started a Javascript Udemy course to refresh and learn Javascript for my internship. I have created this project. I am sure it needs a lot of improvements. Given the time constraints I will not perfect the code, since I have to cover lots of topics in 15 days. 

These are some of the screenshots of this little project.
